This is a reflection file for lesson 3.

1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to make a copy in the cloud, so I will not lose my files if my local computer crashes. 
  Or if I want to cooperate with others.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because my cooperator might change the remote, and I want to have a local copy of my own version. I need to double check what changes the remote have before pull the changes into my local version.
